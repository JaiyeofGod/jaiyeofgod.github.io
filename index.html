    <h1 style= "text-align: center;"> Boluwatife Daniel Kalejaiye</h1>
    <p> My name is Boluwatife Daniel Kalejaiye, and I am a third year Computer Science student at North Carolina A&T State University. 
        I work hard in my classes and have earned high grades over multiple semesters. 
        I also serve currently in the U.S. Marine Corps, which has taught me discipline, responsibility, leadership & teamwork.
        I am focused on building a better future for myself and my family. 
        Outside of school, I enjoy learning new skills, playing soccer, solving problems 
        and challenging myself to grow both in school and in life.
